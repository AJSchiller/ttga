/**
 * Collection of all data belonging to a river.
 *
 * This class manages the creation of the heightmap, DCEL, MS-complex, and so
 * on. This needs to happen in a background thread to not block the GUI while
 * the computation takes place. To ensure thread-safety, this class provides
 * read-write locks (QReadWriteLock). When using a data element (for example,
 * to draw it in the GUI), the corresponding read lock must be acquired first.
 * During the computation of a data element, the corresponding write lock must
 * be acquired before writing back the result. (Note that it does not make
 * sense to keep the write lock during the entire computation, since that
 * defeats the purpose of being able to update the GUI while the computation
 * runs in the background. One should only obtain the write lock to copy back
 * the result.)
 *
 * This ensures that while several threads may read the
 * data simultaneously, it can never be written to at the same time (and it
 * is not possible for several threads to write simultaneously). For more
 * details, see the QReadWriteLock documentation.
